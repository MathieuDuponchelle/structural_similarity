quick README to explain usage:

Two example frames are included, cmp.data and cmp2.data, you can display them with gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=cmp.data ! videoparse ! imagefreeze ! xvimagesink

They are 320 x 240 frames, so :

make && ./ssim_compare_yuv cmp.data cmp2.data 320 240

The displayed float result is the percentage of similarity between the two frames, look at the code to learn more.
